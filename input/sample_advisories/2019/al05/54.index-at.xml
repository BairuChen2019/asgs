Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 6 2019<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane<br/>
Dorian, located offshore of the northeastern coast of North<br/>
Carolina.  The National Hurricane Center is also issuing advisories<br/>
on Tropical Storm Gabrielle, which quickly regenerated this morning<br/>
about 1000 miles southwest of the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located just southwest of the Cabo<br/>
Verde Islands is producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity.<br/>
Little, if any, development of this disturbance is expected for the<br/>
next couple of days, but environmental conditions are likely to<br/>
become more conducive for a tropical depression to form by Tuesday<br/>
or Wednesday while the system moves westward across the tropical<br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized cloudiness and showers located a few hundred miles<br/>
northeast of the Leeward Islands are associated with a trough of<br/>
low pressure.  Significant development of this system is not<br/>
expected during the next several days while it moves slowly<br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082019
500 PM AST Fri Sep 06 2019

Gabrielle has become somewhat better organized during the past few
hours, with a better-defined surface circulation moving closer to a
large burst of convection in the northern semicircle.  There has
been little change in the intensity estimates, so the initial wind
speed will stay 40 kt on this advisory.

The storm continues to move to the northwest at about 15 kt.  A
large subtropical ridge to the northeast of Gabrielle is forecast to
build westward, forcing the tropical cyclone to turn west-
northwestward on Saturday.  After that time, southwesterly flow
ahead of Hurricane Dorian should turn Gabrielle quickly northward
and northeastward by early next week.  Other than some minor speed
differences, the models continue to be tightly packed.  The new
NHC track forecast is basically an update of the previous one, and
it lies near the NOAA corrected-consensus model.

Southerly shear currently near Gabrielle is forecast to relax by
late tomorrow, at about the same time that it moves over very warm
waters near 29C.  This should promote strengthening, and it is
possible that Gabrielle could intensify quickly near recurvature.
By 96 h, the cyclone should move north of the Gulf Stream, with
increasing shear. These conditions should cause a fast extratropical
transition between 96-120 h.  The new NHC prediction is raised at 48
and 72 hours, and it should be noted that quite a few models show
Gabrielle becoming a category 2 hurricane at some point during that
time.

* East of Bar Harbor to Eastport ME
* Prince Edward Island
* Southwestern Nova Scotia from Avonport to Hubbards

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fundy National Park to Shediac
* Parson's Pond to Triton
* Indian Harbour to Stone's Cove

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
during the next 12 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.
This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons located within these
areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property
from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.
Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local
officials.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be rushed to completion.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 36 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts of
the United States should monitor the progress of Dorian.

For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Dorian was located
near latitude 36.9 North, longitude 72.7 West. Dorian is moving
toward the northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h), and this general motion
with an additional increase in forward speed is expected through
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Dorian should
move move to the southeast of extreme southeastern New England
tonight and Saturday morning, and then across Nova Scotia late
Saturday or Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible during the next 24 hours.
After that time, Dorian is forecast to become a post-tropical
cyclone with hurricane-force winds Saturday night or Sunday while
it is near or over eastern Canada.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to
230 miles (370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will persist for a few more hours
in the warning area over the Mid-Atlantic states.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area over portions of extreme
southeastern Massachusetts tonight or early Saturday, and in the
warning area in Maine Saturday afternoon.

Regardless of whether Dorian is a hurricane or a post-tropical
cyclone, hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning
area Saturday or Saturday night, and they are possible in the
Hurricane Watch area Saturday or Saturday night.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning area in Canada
by Saturday, and they are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area
Saturday and Saturday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Salter Path to the North Carolina/Virginia border, including Pamlico
and Albemarle Sounds...2 to 4 ft

Water levels could begin to rise well in advance of the arrival of
strong winds.  The surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the how close
the center of Dorian comes to the coast, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

Storm Surge is likely in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Southwest
Coast of Newfoundland, and Eastern Nova Scotia.

RAINFALL:  Dorian is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals through Saturday:

Extreme Southeastern New England and far eastern Maine...1 to 4
inches.

Nova Scotia...3 to 5 inches, isolated 7 inches.

New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island...2 to 4 inches

Newfoundland...1 to 2 inches

This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods

SURF:  Large swells will affect much of the southeastern United
States coast from northern Florida through North Carolina during
the next couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Dorian Discussion Number  53
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052019
1100 AM EDT Fri Sep 06 2019

The eye of Dorian made landfall over Cape Hatteras, North Carolina,
at about 1235 UTC and then moved quickly northeastward into the
Atlantic.  A combination of surface observations and Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that the maximum
winds are near 80 kt and the central pressure is near 957 mb.  The
hurricane remains well-organized in satellite imagery, with
the 30 n mi wide eye surrounded by cold convective banding.

The initial motion is now 045/15.  Dorian should accelerate
northeastward during the next 24-36 h as a mid- to upper-level
trough, currently over the U.S. Great Lakes, approaches the system
and accelerates the steering flow.  The track guidance remains
tightly clustered, and the new track forecast is changed little in
either direction or speed from the previous forecast.  The new
forecast calls for Dorian to move away from the North Carolina
coast today, pass well southeast of southern New England tonight
and Saturday, and then move over Nova Scotia Saturday or Saturday
night.  A continued northeastward motion is then expected to bring
the cyclone across Newfoundland into the far north Atlantic.

Dorian is expected to slowly weaken due to increased shear and
entrainment of drier air during the next 24 h or so.  After that
time, the hurricane is expected to undergo extratropical
transition and become a large and powerful post-tropical low.  It is
unclear whether the transition will be complete before Dorian
reaches Nova Scotia.  However, whether Dorian is a hurricane or a
hurricane-force extratropical low, it is expected to bring strong
winds, storm surge, and heavy rains to portions of Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland.  The new NHC intensity forecast is little changed from
the previous forecast, and it follows the trend of the intensity
guidance.

Key Messages:

1. Life-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds will continue
along portions of the North Carolina coast, portions of southeast
Virginia and the southern Chesapeake Bay for the next several
hours.

2. Areas of flash flooding, some of which may be significant and
life-threatening, will continue into early afternoon across portions
of northeastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia.

3. Dangerous storm surge impacts are likely in portions of the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, southwestern Newfoundland and eastern Nova Scotia
this weekend. Hurricane-force winds are also likely in Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward Island and possibly Newfoundland Saturday and Sunday.
Refer to information from the Canadian Hurricane Centre for more
information on these hazards.
